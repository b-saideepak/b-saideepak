This blog will be mostly technical. Although you can find some other stuff if you sneak in. The main reason behind me starting this blog is to share the information which I learn everyday. There are many things that you learn in your day-to-day life. It will be of great help if you start giving this knowledge to everyone around you who are trying to learn the samething.

I myself had struggled lot of times not having a resource which tells you easily and it takes effort and time to learn such things. But once you learn it, you can see that was not so difficult. I want to share what all I learn so that new people can avoid the struggles that I had faced when learning them. 

As a CS guy you might have to learn many tools like vim, git, linux, programming, simulators if you are in architecture field. I am learning these stuff these days and I am going to list basic tutorials on these if that can help.
