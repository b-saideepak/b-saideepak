## Welcome to the Linux World
* * *
Linux is such a beauty. There is so much you can do if you know the commands in Linux. Soon you will say GUI is nothing
and the terminal is everything. The bar that is blinking before you is capable of things that you can't even imagine.

Do you know that a single command can erase your entire memory?

```bash
rm -rf /*
```

Please don't try this at home. I mean not at your home directory. It is injurious to your PC.

Please join me into the journey of commands where you can rule the linux world.
