Linux is such a beauty. There is so much you can do if you know the commands in Linux. Soon you will say GUI is nothing
and the terminal is everything. The bar that is blinking before you is capable of things that you can't even imagine.

Do you know that a single command can erase your entire memory?

```bash
$ rm -rf /*
```
Please don't try this at home. I mean not at your home directory. It is injurious to your PC.

Please join me into the journey of commands where you can rule the linux world.

## mv command
```bash
$ mv file1 file2
```
mv command moves your content from file1 to file2. You can this command to rename files. No right-clicking and choosing the rename options. Be careful when file2 has some content in it. file1 contents will override the contents of file2. This is the harsh truth of linux commands that you cannot undo them once done. You can always use -i option with mv command so that it will ask for your consent before performing the operation.

## cp command
```bash
$ cp file1 file2
```
cp command copies the contents of file1 to file2. There are several options that you can try with linux commands.
you can always use
```bash
$ man cp
```
to get the details of any command in linux.
