# Calorie Intake

Never I understood the real meaning behind this. More than understanding I should say I never paid attention to that word. Now I have to, because that stage has come where I have to take care of what I am eating. Until now, I have no constraints on my diet, I used to eat whatever I liked without any other thought. But that will not work for my life style. Years from now I can see I would spend more time in front of a laptop not doing much physical activity. In that case you should be careful with what you are eating. Otherwise, there are high chances that you can become obese. If you are a person who would spend most of the time in front of a laptop then you should too be carefull about what you are eating.


Let us say you start your day with 1 cup sambar with 3 idli (369g), it has around ~304 calories. For lunch let say you went out with friends and ate a chicken biryani along with thumbs up. It constitutes to ~630 calories(500 + 130). For dinner say you ate at home, rice and curry, that would correspond to 400 calories. Total it sums upto 1300-1400 calories. If you are not doing physical work worth this much amount of calories, that will deposit as fat and will soon make you obese in a long run.

So, it is highly important to gauge what you are eating, and how many calories you are actually buring. If there is a significant difference in this, that might make you obese and fat and might settle as belly fat even in a young age. Having a fat belly has many disadvantages. 

I am not saying you should stop yourself eating foods you like. But make sure you burn those calories by doing workouts. Especially, eating too much at night is very dangerous because you will not do much physical activity at night except sleeping so the probability of fat depositing will be higher if you take high calorie food at night. Either have early dinner so that you can have some activity before sleep or eat less. Heavy meals at late night is the worst thing that you can do to yourself.

We are used to eat lots and lots of rice as a typical south indian(if you are one.), rice actually has high calorie content. We the laptop guys should not eat that much rice as we do not work out that much. Instead eat curries more because they have less calories and high protiens and other useful nutrients.

## Bottom Line: Eat but Workout. If you are not sure, measure the calories and burn them accordingly. Eating and not doing any physical activity is the worst thing that you can do to yourself.
