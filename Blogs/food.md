# Calorie Intake

Never I understood the real meaning behind this. More than understanding I should say I never paid attention to that word. Now I have to, because that stage has come where I have to take care of what I am eating. Until now, I have no constraints on my diet, I used to eat whatever I liked without any other thought. But that will not work for my life style. Years from now I can see I would spend more time in front of a laptop not doing much physical activity. In that case you should be careful with what you are eating. Otherwise, there are high chances that you can become obese. If you are a person who would spend most of the time in front of a laptop then you should too be carefull about what you are eating.
