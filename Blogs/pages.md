## Github Pages
It is one of the best place to create your blogs if you are planning to create one.
 
I will take through a quick process how to create one.

* * *
* First thing is that you should have a github account. If you don't have one go ahead and create one [here](https://github.com)
* Then you have to create your first repository with the same name as your github username. Note that this step is not mandatory as you can create github page for any repository you have.
* Click on settings tab and scroll down untill you find an option for github pages there you can choose the option to launch the pages at your master branch. Note that there are other places that you can launch the pages like gh-pages, /doc. We are going to simply launch at the master branch.
* Below this, you can also choose a theme for your github page. There are several themes you can select the theme which you like the most.
* Then goto the url: https://user-name.github.io and there you go your github page is live.
