## Github Pages
It is one of the best place to create your blogs if you are planning to create one.

I will take through a quick process how to create one.

* * *
* First thing is that you should have a github account. If you don't have one go ahead and create one [here](https://github.com)
* Then you have to create your first repository with the same name as your github username. Note that this step is not mandatory as you can create github page for any repository you have.
